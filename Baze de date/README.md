Management of an Orphanage, laboratory work: [Orfelinat](https://github.com/cristianamihu/UBB_Computer-Science/tree/main/Baze%20de%20date/Orfelinat)

Management of a cake eating competition, practical exam: entities of interest are competitors, cakes, types of cakes and ingredients. In addition to these tables, I also made a connection table between competitors and cakes "Cake Consumption" in order to record the amount of cakes eaten by the competitors.
  1. After creating the tables I created a stored procedure that receives a competitor, a cake and a quantity and adds the cake to the respective competitor. If the cake has already been associated with the respective competitor, the quantity will be updated.
  2. I created a view that displays the name and email address of the contestants who ate cakes with 'mousse de fructe' as their main ingredient but did not eat cakes with 'mousse de vanilie' as their main ingredient.
