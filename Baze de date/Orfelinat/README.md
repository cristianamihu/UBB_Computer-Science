Management of an orphanage:\n
   -I represented the database data in a relational structure, implementing it in the Microsoft SQL Server database.\n
   -I created queries that use where, group by, distinct, having; and which extract information from more than two tables or which are made on tables located in reality many to may.\n
   -we developed a versioning mechanism that facilitates the transition from one version of the database to another. I wrote SQL scripts that: change the type of a column, add a "default value" constraint for
a field, create a table, add a new field, add a foreign key constraint. For all these operations, we also implemented their inverse, to "delete" the operation when we return to a previous version. In another
table I memorized the version of the database structure.\n
   -using a script to create some tables, I recorded several test configurations and implemented stored procedures for evaluation and storage of test results.\n
   -we created raw operations encapsulated in stored procedures, using input/output parameters, functions to validate input data and table/column constraints to ensure data validity.\n
